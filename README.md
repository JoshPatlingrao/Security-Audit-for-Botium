### Controls Assessment Checklist

| Yes | No | Control | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | X | Least Privilege | All employees have access to internally stored data, customer PII/SPII and credit card information. Access needs to be limited based on roles to reduce risk of data breach. |
| | X | Disaster Recovery Plan | No disaster recovery plan in place. The company has no plan of recvoery in case of breach. Highly urgent as it ensures that company can return to normal operations in case of security incident. |
| | X | Password Policies | Password policies are enforced but the requirements are nominal and current minimum password complexity doesn't comply with NIST standards. Password policies need to be updated to strengthen password security. |
| | X | Separation of Duties | Access controls regarding separation of duties are not implemented. Policies need to be enforced to minimise risk or data breach as well as provide some form of accounting. |
| X | | Firewall | Firewall is active and blocks traffic based on appropriately defined rules. |
| | X | Intrusion Detection System | IDS not installed. IT department needs a way to detect and/or prevent malicious activity or traffic. |
| | X | Backups | No backups implemented. Data loss would severely cripple the company due to lack of backups. Regular backups will be required as part of disaster recovery plan. |
| X | | Antivirus Software | Antivirus is active and regularly monitored by the IT department. |
| | X | Manual Monitoring, Maintenance and Intervention for Legacy Systems | Legacy systems are monitored and maintained but at irregular intervals. Furthermore current playbooks are unclear regarding intervention methods. Legacy systems need to be regularly and frequently monitored due to unpatched vulnerabilities. Playbook also needs to be updated to be more concise for an effective response. |
| | X | Encryption | Not implemented. Customer credit card information transmitted within internal network in clear text. Encryption needed to provide confidentiality to customer credit card information, PII and SPII. |
| | X | Password Management System | No centralized password management to enforce password policies. If implemented then employee productivity will increase due to reduced tickets from password issues. |
| X | | Physical Locks | Physical locks are in place in offices, store front and warehouse. |
| X | | CCTV Surveillance | Surveillance cameras are up to date and regularly monitored. |
| X | | Fire Detection/Prevention | Fire detection and prevention systems in place and functional. |
